.SH "RECONNECT"
ExpressVPN will attempt to automatically reconnect to VPN if the connection is interrupted\.
.SH "NETWORK LOCK AND LEAK PROTECTION"
ExpressVPN supports various preferences for ensuring your Internet traffic and private information don\'t leak both whilst connected and during reconnection (should the VPN connection be disrupted)\.
.P
The preferences are described below\. Each can be set using \fBexpressvpn preferences set\fR\.
.P
Note that all of the preferences except \fBipv6_protection\fR require iptables(8) to be installed\. If iptables(8) isn\'t available then these preferences will be unavailable\.
.SS "NETWORK LOCK"
Once connected, firewall rules will be put in place to prevent IP traffic from leaving the device except via the VPN tunnel\. These rules prevent leaks during reconnection\. If reconnection fails terminally then the application will leave the firewall rules up to protect you from leaks\. This will mean your network will be disabled\.
.P
To determine if ExpressVPN is blocking your internet traffic, run \fBexpressvpn status\fR\. If you network is blocked then you can unblock it either by running \fBexpressvpn disconnect\fR or \fBexpressvpn connect\fR\.
.P
There are three possible \fBnetwork_lock\fR modes: \fBoff\fR, \fBstrict\fR and \fBdefault\fR\.
.TP
\fBoff\fR
Network Lock is disabled\.
.TP
\fBstrict\fR
All traffic will be blocked if ExpressVPN disconnects unexpectedly\.
.TP
\fBdefault\fR
Blocks all internet traffic, but allow traffic to local (private) IP address ranges (10\.0\.0\.0/8, 172\.16\.0\.0/12, 192\.168\.0\.0/16)\. This is useful, for example, for communicating with printers on your local network\. This is the default mode\.
.SS "IPV6 LEAK PROTECTION"
Disables ipv6 in the kernel to prevent IPv6 addresses leaking out, e\.g\. via WebRTC\. Since ExpressVPN only supports an IPv4 tunnel, enabling this setting should have no impact on your system\. IPv6 Leak protection is enabled by default\.
.TP
To disable IPv6 Leak protection
\fBexpressvpn preferences set ipv6_protection false\fR
.TP
To enable IPv6 Leak protection again
\fBexpressvpn preferences set ipv6_protection true\fR
